    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Easy Chicken Marsala is an easy take on the classic Italian-American dish
      of chicken dressed in a marsala wine sauce. It is a traditional Italian
      dish which has many different variations. This dish may have originated
      from English people living in western Sicily, where Marsala Wine is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dish is usually made with chicken breast coated in flour, sauteed,
      and then removed from the pan. Once removed from the pan the remaining
      contents of the pan is reduced with Marsala Wine to make the sauce. The
      sauce is made by reducing the wine until it is like a syrup consistency
      with added garlic. Some even add butter to the sauce.
